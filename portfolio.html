                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne of my best works was made for a project in English 12. This was a "declaration" of my life, which included my early life, growing up,
                        and then to today (last year). I am extremely proud of the resulting video and I believe it is one of the best demonstrations of my work so
                        far.

                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnother of my best works was for last semester's CSCI 1105. For our first assignment (before even being introduced to loops), we had
                        to make a version of the video game Pong. For my version of Pong, I wanted to introduce not only just the game, but also a large variety
                        of settings so that the game is more applicable to others. Don't link the black background? Change it to blue! Don't like how slow the
                        ball is? Make it faster! Don't like how the game ends? Make it never end! That was my mindset for the creation of the assignment, and
                        while I think many, many aspects of the code could've been optimised, I'm very happy with the resulting product. Below is a video of the
                        code and the program:

                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn 2019 I got my first "job" as a video editor. This was done for my Uncle's Youtube channel, where one of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nexoic32bRo" target="_blank">edited videos</a> (the only one I could find) <!--[5]-->
                        has 680 thousand views and, in my opinion, kicked off his channel by creating slightly better content than just looking at a camera and recording. I edited a
                        total of three videos here and made about $100-200. The edits in the video, by my standards today, are not the best (difficult to read text, very minimal
                        edits, etc), but this first position taught me a lot about how to better edit videos and really helped me to understand a working environment with deadlines
                        and such.

                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn August 2022 I got my first "real job" at Sobey's. I worked there for 1 year until I started at DAL, and now I am currently on leave. My job primarily 
                        consisted of preparing and cooking the rotisserie chickens and also serving customers food such as fries, chicken wings, salads, fried rice, etc. During this 
                        time I've been praised by both of my managers for my attention to detail (in cleaning) and great work ethic (coming on a day off if needed). One of my 
                        proudest moments during my time was that after only about 9 months of working there, I got picked to train a new employee. I think that because of all of
                        this hard work, I got to take a ~8-month leave from the job, something that is likely very rare for a minimum wage position, because they really wanted me 
                        back. I plan to work there again during the summer of 2024.
